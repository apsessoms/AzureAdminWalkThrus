# Configure Azure Disk Encryption: A Step-by-Step Guide

This guide walks you through the process of configuring Azure Disk Encryption, ensuring that your data remains secure.

## Prerequisites

- An active Azure Subscription.
- An existing Virtual Machine (VM) in your Azure environment.

## Step 1: Access Key Vault

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://www.portal.azure.com).
2. Search for "Key Vault" in the search bar.

**Note**: You must have a Key Vault to store your encryption secret, whether you are using your own encryption key or not. üóùÔ∏è

## Step 2: Create Key Vault

Key Vault is used to store secret information like encryption keys, API keys, passwords, etc.

1. **Resource Group**: Follow a good naming schema to keep your environment organized.
2. **Region**: Ensure it's in the same region as your Virtual Machine for Azure Disk Encryption.

3. Configure other instance details as needed or leave them as default.

## Step 3: Access Configuration

1. On the "Access configuration" page, select "Azure Disk Encryption for volume encryption."

2. Leave the rest of the configuration as default, review your settings, and click "Create."

## Step 4: Verify Key Vault Creation

Once complete, you should receive a confirmation message.

## Step 5: Set Up Azure Disk Encryption

1. Return to the portal and navigate to your virtual machines (ensure your VM is running).
2. Click on **additional settings**.

3. Choose between:
   - **Encrypt the OS disk**.
   - **Encrypt the OS and data disks** (for this walkthrough, choose the OS disk only).

4. Select the Key Vault.

   **Important**: If the Key Vault isn't visible, your virtual machine and Key Vault are **not in the same region**.

5. Optional: Select an additional key if you want to encrypt the encryption secret stored in your Key Vault (known as a customer managed key, or CMK).

6. Click "Create," and once complete, you can verify that your disk is secure.

### Security Layers:

- **Server Side Encryption (SSE)**: Data at rest in Microsoft's global infrastructure. üåç
- **Azure Disk Encryption (ADE)**: Enabled in Azure Key Vault. üóùÔ∏è
